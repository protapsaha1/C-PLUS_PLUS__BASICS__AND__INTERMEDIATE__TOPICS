*** "C++ control Structures" is three types. This three is basics control structure. 
1.Sequence Structure
2.Selection Structure
3.Loop Structure

*** Sequence Structure >>
FIRST ENTRY ON THE CODE STRUCTURE
THEN ACTION 1, ACTION 2, ACTION 3 
LIKE SEQUENCLY
AND LAST EXIT THE CODE

*** Selection Structure >>
FIRST ENTRY ON THE CODE STRUCTURE
THEN CREATE CONDITION 
IF CONDITION IS TRUE GIVE THE VALUE OR
IF CONDITION IS FALSE BLOCK THE VALUE
AFTER FULFILL THE CONDITION EXIT IN THE CODE

*** Loop Structure >>
FIRST ENTRY ON THE CODE STRUCTURE,
CHECK A CONDITION,
IF CONDITION IS TRUE GO ON ACTION1, 
IN ACTION1 CREATE A LOOP NATURAL NUMBER,
TAKE A VARIABLE i = 0 ,
IF i <= 10000 ADD 1: (i = 1) ,
THIS LOOP IS CONTINUE UNTILL THE i EQUAL TO AND LESS THAN 10000 ;
OR IF CONDITION IS FALSE THE LOOP INSTANTLY OFF AND ,
EXIT THE LOOP GO ON ACTION2 ,
THEN EXIT IN THE CODE .
